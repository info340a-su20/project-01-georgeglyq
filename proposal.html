    <h1>What is the situation of COVID-19 in your neighborhood?</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>COVID-19 is detrimental to everyone’s health, but its severity is overlooked by a large number of people in the United States, not only because of the lack of awareness, but also due to insufficient and ineffective media exposure. For instance, two of the most well-known COVID-19 tracker sites, <a href="http://covid19.healthdata.org/projections">Worldometers</a> and <a href="https://coronavirus.1point3acres.com">1Point3Acres</a> provide inconsistent information regarding the number of cases, deaths, and, especially, recovered population. As of July 25, Worldometers states 2.03 million have recovered from COVID-19, whereas 1Point3Acres says only 1.26 million have recovered. People do not know which source provides correct information.</p>
        <p>In addition, those numbers are generally for health officials to understand the current situation. It isn’t really helpful for individuals to get a thorough overview of how dangerous COVID-19 is around where they live. For instance, as of July 25, there are fewer than 100 active cases in Vermont, whereas Florida has approximately 15,000 new cases every day. Even within Florida, Lafayette county has only 82 cases in total, while Miami-Dade county has more than 100,000. </p>

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>My app/website will primarily focus on helping individuals identify the current situation of COVID-19 in their neighborhoods so they have a better idea with regards to the spread of this pandemic around them. The potential users will be everyone in Washington state because it involves tons of work load to keep track of everywhere in the US, given the scope of the course and time constraint. Users will be expected to input their location, places they’ve been to within a specific time range, number of hours they’ve been outside, etc. The app will then show corresponding line charts such as patterns of growth or decline, along with suggestions/measures people are expected to take based on the statistics. It will also calculate a score/percentage that represents the likelihood of one getting the virus. In other words, users get to know if they are doing the right thing every day.</p>
        <p>The app will seek to gather some of the data from state/county <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/emergencies/coronavirus">Department of Health</a> website for the COVID-19 cases information. But we know that all county calculate data differently. For instance, some do not track recovered cases which makes the total active cases inaccurate. My app will normalize all the data and treat all cases non-hospitalized after 14 days as recovered cases. The app will also refer to the <a href="http://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america">COVID-19 Prediction</a> website, established by the University of Washington when making suggestions.</p>
        <p>After all, making an app/website that caters to the well-being of each and every individual within a smaller region is beneficial and can potentially raise more awareness so that people cease to form the “This Won’t Happen To Me” mindset.</p>
